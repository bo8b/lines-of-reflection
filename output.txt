Sophie: Ali Lisa where have you been? I thought you'd get here hours ago.
Ali: What a journey! Guess who left their ticket on the kitchen table.
Lisa: We said "We have to get on this plane - it's our best friend's wedding tomorrow."
Sophie: Lisa!
Lisa: Sophie!
Ali: We made such a fuss. ....We were in that plane even without the ticket!
Lisa: So where is he then. Your Sky? We are dying to meet him.
Ali: How's your mum? I bet Donna's been going nuts over this wedding.
Sophie: Yeah well listen I've got a secret and you're the only ones I can tell.
Lisa: Oh my god! You're pregnant.
