Lisa:,So where is he then. Your Sky? We are dying to meet him.
Ali:,How's your mum? I bet Donna's been going nuts over this wedding.
Sophie:,Yeah well listen I've got a secret and you're the only ones I can tell.
Lisa:,Oh my god! You're pregnant.
Sophie:,No! I'm inviting my Dad to my wedding.
Ali:,Your Dad?
Lisa:,You mean you've found him at last?
Sophie:,Not exactly! Look I found this in Mum's desk. 
Ali:,Sophie you're not supposed to go around reading your Mum's diary!
Lisa:,No! She's supposed to go around reading yours.
Sophie:,But Look! 1979 the one she kept the year she fell pregnant with me.
Sophie:,You know how she won't talk about my Dad says she cant remember. Huh!
Sophie:,July 17th. What a night. After the show Sam rode me over to the little island.
Sophie:,We danced on the beach and kissed on the beach and...
Ali:,What?
